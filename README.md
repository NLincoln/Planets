# Planets
Planets, when finished, will be the realization of an idea I've been thinking about off and on for a few years, and so far it's proving to be an intense learning experience

Throughout the duration of this continuing project, I have gained insight on a number of topics, including graph theory. For example, in the src/GraphManager.h file, there is an experimental implementation of a header-only template based graph library. If you read the commit logs, you will see the evolution of this library from a small portion of another, much larger system, to a complex and rich component that stands on it's own. 

######Features that are yet to be implemented
* Djikstra's
* Meaningful output to the user
* Space pirates component
* Several smaller parts of components that are unimplemented
* Replace the current way of generating the graph with delauney triangulation (current method is incredibly inefficient)
